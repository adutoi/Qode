# It is worth noting that it does not really matter what one uses as the base units.
# Even though we are doing quantum calculations, we could have set up SI units, and,
# from the outside we would not be able to tell the difference as long as all the symbols
# here are defined and internally consistent.  However, it just seems like a good idea
# to set even the internal working unit system such that the numbers of interest are 
# not particularly large or small.

# The base unit system for our calculations (supplement the electromechanical portion of a.u. with SI temperature)

# *If you don't do this, you cannot really equate hartrees and J/mol.  You can equate hartrees/individual and J/mol, but then you need
# to set either mol or individual as your fundamental unit and use N_A to define the other.  Then you are stuck writing things like
