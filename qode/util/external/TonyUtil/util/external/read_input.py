"""\
This module is dedicated to reading input out of python-syntax files that might just contain parameter definitions.

This has the dual benefits of making them quite flexible even without having to write a single line of parser code,
but, at the same time, the contents can be completely limited to parameter declarations (no import statements or other
"overhead"), even while the name of the file is dynamic (which cannot be accomplished easily using either imports of
parameters from the main code, or imports of the main code from the parameter code).

One of the more powerful aspects here is namespacing.  The user can import namespaces into the input file directly,
but also the code that asks for the reading and execution of the input file can pass it its namespace dictionary
(or any other namespace for that matter), making available names from other modules, or perhaps macros to lower
the pain of writing input files.  Finally, there is an as-of-yet unused option of defining some kind of default
namespaces (local to a module, or a class that calls the methods below?).

The only drawback is that any parser errors will come back in "pythonese" which will not make sense to many
end users.  The proposed solution is another function (a plain text parser in the same module that defines input-level
namespaces?) that checks *simple* inputs for sanity (including whether they make physical sense, not just whether they
are parseable).  This check can be turned off by an intro line like (parse_check = False) that triggers the parse checker
to stop checking.  Then more advanced users can do things like embed loops, and other things that the parse checker 
does not like . . . try-except is also probably my friend in this battle.
