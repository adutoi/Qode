Qode
================================================================================

*Qode* is a python-based library for experimental quantum chemistry code.



Description
-----------

*Qode* is organized into modules that . . .

**Features**

* think
* of some good
* things to put here



Usage
-----

quickstart
^^^^^^^^^^

Some small examples here.

full documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After cloning, point your browser to the file `docs/html/index.html` 
(also hosted on 
`ReadTheDocs <https://qode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_).
See also the `docs/samples/` directory.



Installation
------------

Cloning this repo and making sure the Qode/ project directory is in your Python
search path.

dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Numpy* and you might need to install an integrals engine unless you want to read
all your integrals from disk (there are hooks for running in a *Psi4* conda environment).

So far this has only been tested for python>=3.7 on *nix systems (specifically
Linux/Mac).

support
^^^^^^^

Email tonydutoi@gmail.com, and I'll do what I can.



Testing and Development
-----------------------

testing
^^^^^^^

In the ``tests/`` directories there will eventually be some basic tests
to ensure the code is installed and working in your environment,
each with some in-place instructions on what is being tested.

contributing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just get in touch with your idea for improvement and we'll discuss.

to-do list
^^^^^^^^^^

* This list
